## Using the State Hook
### Hooks and Function Components
* Hooks don't work inside classes.But you can use them instead of writing classes.
### What's a Hook ?
* A Hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features.
### Declaring a State Variable
* Normally,variables "disappear" when the funciton exits but state variables are preserved by React

### Recap
* We promise that once you try to "forget" how state works in classes, and look at this code with fresh eyes, it will make sense.
